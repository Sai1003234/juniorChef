Vanilla Pounded "thing" cake

INGREDIENDS -_-

1 cup (225 g) of unsalted butter, softened
1 cup (225 g) of granulated sugar
Pinch of salt
2 teaspoons (9.9 mL) of vanilla extract
5 eggs, room temperature[1]
2 cups (240 g) of cake flour (or, you can use 2 cups minus 2 tbsp (234 g) of all-purpose flour plus 2 tbsp (16 g) of cornstarch)[2]

STEPS TO MAKE:

STEP1:Gather your ingredients. Pound cake is one of the simplest cakes to bake.

STEP2:Preheat the oven to 325 °F (163 °C) and grease and flour a cake pan. Pound cakes are best baked in deep pans, such as loaf pans or bundt pans. Use butter or shortening to grease the pan. Then, sprinkle a light layer of flour into the pan, rotate the pan until it's evenly coated, then tap out the excess flour.

STEP3:
Cream the butter and sugar. Place the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat them together until the mixture is light, fluffy and creamy

STEP4:
Add the eggs and vanilla. For best results, add the eggs one at a time and beat the mixture in between. Keep beating the mixture until the eggs are completely incorporated.

STEP5:
Stir in the cake flour. Keep the electric mixer on low or use a wooden spoon to stir the flour in a bit at a time until it's just incorporated. Be careful not to overmix it.[8]

STEP6:
Pour the batter into the pan. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.

STEP7:
Bake the cake for 1 hour 15 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees halfway through the cook time to ensure it bakes evenly. The cake is finished when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Enjoy your delicious homemade cake!
